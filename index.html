                <center><b>Midnight Yell</b> is a tradition at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html/">Texas A&M University</a> where students, alumni, or <u>anyone else</u> who has the desire to come, gather to practice the yells that will be performed by the Yell Leaders and A&M fans at the game the following day. Texas A&M University is unique in the fact that at games, cheerleaders are not present. Instead, Yell Leaders <i>“lead”</i> the crowd to cheer the team along with them. This started when the university was an all male school. The tradition took place for 18 years before it was an official event held by Texas A&M in 1931. Midnight Yell welcomes anyone and everyone to prepare for the upcoming game. At Midnight Yell, the forecomers learn about the history of the rivalry between Texas A&M and the school that they are playing the next day, practice the yells, or chants that will be performed, and get excited for the game. There are countless traditions within the tradition of Midnight Yell itself, which all adds to the Aggie spirit.</center>
